      "category": "Introduction",
      "content": "This booklet by PFRDA Financial Literacy and Training Department introduces retirement education and awareness. It emphasizes earning financial freedom early in life to avoid financial worries in retirement. Retirement is defined as the stage when one stops working and lives on accumulated savings. Post-retirement needs include household expenses, family support, recreation, and medical expenses. Planning early ensures financial independence during golden years."

      "title": "Importance of Retirement Planning",
      "category": "Retirement Basics",
      "content": "Retirement planning involves estimating required savings to sustain expenses after retirement. In India, individuals may live more than 20 years post-retirement at age 60. Without planning, individuals risk insufficient wealth and may require re-employment. Increased life expectancy and rising costs demand systematic savings. Planning early reduces the risk of running out of funds later."

      "category": "Pension Concept",
      "content": "Pension is described as the primary financial support during retirement. It is not limited to government employees; anyone can obtain a pension. A pension provides guaranteed, fixed monthly income sourced from accumulated funds. It ensures stable post-retirement income and financial security."

      "title": "Start Early – Power of Compounding",
      "category": "Savings Strategy",
      "content": "Individuals can plan retirement between ages 18 and 70. Starting early reduces monthly contribution requirements and increases retirement corpus. Example: A 25-year-old with ₹10,000 current expenses retiring at 60 (inflation 5%, return 10%) needs ₹2,236 monthly and corpus of ₹85 lakh. Delayed planning significantly increases required contributions. Compounding over long periods enhances retirement wealth."

      "title": "Factors to Keep in Mind",
      "category": "Retirement Planning Factors",
      "content": "Key considerations include retirement age, expected monthly expenses, inflation impact, and return on pension investments. Example: ₹10,000 current expense becomes ₹43,000 at retirement with 5% inflation. Early retirement requires higher monthly savings. Fixed deposits (6%) yield lower corpus than equity (12%). Risk-return balance must align with retirement goals."

(3) Explore pension plans and compare features such as guaranteed pension, asset classes, transparency, cost, regulation, service delivery, and grievance mechanisms. Low-cost, transparent, well-regulated plans are preferable."

      "category": "Retirement Income Strategy",
      "content": "Lump sum retirement funds may deplete quickly, often within five years. Pension/annuity provides regular predictable income, better financial security, and controlled spending. Lump sum offers flexibility but increases risk of overspending and depletion. Regular pension ensures lifelong payments and better financial management."
